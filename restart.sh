# delegates to launchctl kickstart / systemctl restart, which re-invoke the
# plist (→ start.sh) / systemd unit (→ node). The WASM blast-radius V8 flags
# (--no-wasm-tier-up --liftoff-only --wasm-lazy-compilation) live in those launch
# targets (start.sh / pi-dashboard.service / run.sh), so a restart re-applies
# them. The server logs the effective V8 flags on boot for verification.
